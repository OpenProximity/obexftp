Introduction
============

flexmem is used to access Flex. Memory on Siemens mobile equipment,
i.e. S45 and ME45.


Short Installation Instructions
===============================

To compile and install:
# ./configure
# make
# make install (as superuser)



Further Development
===================

If you find this tool useful or actually like it let me know.
Development will cease otherwise. Currently I know of 3 people
using this tool (including me). So that proposal is not too
unfair, see?

If you are a developer and want to use obexftp library or even
cobex_bfb library do so. But please keep me informed - I'll send
you pre-releases. That way your application is able to exploit the
newest library features.
