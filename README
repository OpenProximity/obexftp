Introduction
============

ObexFTP implements the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocols file transfer feature.

The standard is defined in more detail in section K12.5 (Profiles: OBEX FTP)
in Bluetooth V1.1 Profile Specifications.

It's current main use is to access Siemens (S/ME45 and SL45) as well as
Ericsson T68i user memory.

This ObexFTP distribution contains libraries as well as some applications.

Applications to access Flex. Memory on Siemens mobile equipment,
i.e. S45, ME45 and SL45 are

 - obexls - list the mobiles contents
 - obexcp - copy to/from mobile
 - obexmd - create a directory on the mobile
 - obexrd - remove an empty directory on the mobile
 - obexrm - remove files on the mobile
 - flexmem - all in one application (heavy on options)

Applications to hack Siemens mobile equipment using datalink cable

 - bfb_keysim - simulate key presses on the mobile
 - bfb_eeprom - list and examine the user eeprom on the mobile

Library parts to be used in other applications

 - obexftp - high level abstraction of OBEX FTP protocol
 - cobex_pe - cable OBEX for Ericsson phones (i.e. T68i)
 - cobex_bfb -  cable OBEX for Siemens phones (i.e. x45, x35, x25)
 - bfb - Siemens mobile datalink cable protocol layer


Short Installation Instructions
===============================

To compile and install:
# ./configure
# make
# make install (as superuser)

Consider using pedantic error checking:
 CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Werror" ./configure


Further Development
===================

If you find this tool useful or actually like it let me know.
Development will ibe slow otherwise. Currently I know of 20 people
using this tool (including me). So that proposal is not too
unfair, see?

If you are a developer and want to use obexftp library or even
cobex/bfb library do so. But please keep me informed - I'll send
you pre-releases. That way your application is able to exploit the
newest library features.
