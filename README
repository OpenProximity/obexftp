Introduction
============

ObexFTP implements the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocols file transfer feature.

The standard is defined in more detail in section K12.5 (Profiles: OBEX FTP)
in Bluetooth V1.1 Profile Specifications.

ObexFTP works out-of-the-box with all protocols supported by OpenOBEX.
Currently IrDA and the there is an upcoming BlueTooth support.
ObexFTP comes with ready to use custom support for some mobile phones serial
cables.

It's well tested with Siemens (S/ME45 and SL45) as well as
Ericsson (T68i) mobile phones.

This ObexFTP distribution contains libraries as well as some applications.

Applications to access e.g. Flex. Memory and Multimedia Card memory on Siemens
mobile equipment, i.e. S45, ME45 and SL42/SL45/SL45i (IrDA only, for now):

 - obexls - list the mobiles contents
 - obexcp - copy to/from mobile
 - obexmd - create a directory on the mobile
 - obexrd - remove an empty directory on the mobile
 - obexrm - remove files on the mobile
 - flexmem - all in one application (heavy on options)

Applications to hack Siemens mobile equipment using datalink cable

 - bfb_keysim - simulate key presses on the mobile
 - bfb_eeprom - list and examine the user eeprom on the mobile

Library parts to be used in other applications

 - obexftp - high level abstraction of OBEX FTP protocol
 - cobex_pe - cable OBEX for Ericsson phones (i.e. T68i)
 - cobex_bfb -  cable OBEX for Siemens phones (i.e. x45, x35, x25)
 - bfb - Siemens mobile datalink cable protocol layer


Short Installation Instructions
===============================

To compile and install:
# ./configure
# make
# make install (as superuser)

Consider using pedantic error checking:
 CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Werror" ./configure


Further Development
===================

If you find this tool useful or actually like it let me know.
Development will focus on your needs. Currently I know of 20 people
using this tool (including me). So that proposal is not too
unfair, see?

This package lacks a full featured GUI. There is some proof of concept
code for GTK and GNOME-VFS. Somebody needs to work on that or perhaps a
KDE tool though.

If you are a developer and want to use obexftp library or even
cobex/bfb library do so. But please keep me informed - I'll send
you pre-releases. That way your application is able to exploit the
newest library features.
