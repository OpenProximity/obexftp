ObexFTP Readme
==============

Introduction
------------

ObexFTP implements the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocols file transfer feature.

The standard is defined in more detail in section K12.5 (Profiles: OBEX FTP)
in Bluetooth V1.1 Profile Specifications.

ObexFTP works out-of-the-box with all protocols supported by OpenOBEX.
Currently IrDA, Bluetooth and there is an upcoming USB support.
ObexFTP comes with ready to use custom transport support for some mobile
phones serial cables.

It's well tested with Siemens and Sony/Ericsson mobile phones. Support for
Motorola phones has been added recently (connection ids are needed there).
Samsung phones might work too, please get back to me on that.

This ObexFTP distribution contains libraries as well as some applications.

Applications to access e.g. Flex. Memory and Multimedia- /Secure Digital Card
memory on mobile equipment:

 - obexls  - list the mobiles contents
 - obexget - copy files(s) to mobile
 - obexput - copy files(s) from mobile
 - obexrm  - remove files on the mobile
 - obexftp - all in one application (heavy on options)

Applications to hack Siemens mobile equipment using datalink cable

 - bfb_keysim - simulate key presses on the mobile
 - bfb_eeprom - list and examine the user eeprom on the mobile

Library parts to be used in other applications

 - obexftp - high level abstraction of OBEX FTP protocol
 - cobex_pe - cable OBEX for Ericsson phones (i.e. T68i)
 - cobex_bfb -  cable OBEX for Siemens phones (i.e. x45, x35, x25)
 - bfb - Siemens mobile datalink cable protocol layer


Short Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

To compile and install:
	# ./configure
	# make
	# make install (as superuser)

If you plan to use a Siemens S45 and no S65 or Ericsson use
	CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DCOMPAT_S45" ./configure
instead

Consider using pedantic error checking:
	CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Werror" ./configure


Further Development
-------------------

If this tool lacks support for your phone or just won't work quite right
please let me know. Development will focus on your needs.

This package lacks a full featured GUI. There are some 3rd party GUIs and
other projects like a obex file system though. Please see the OpenOBEX /
ObexFTP web site for details.

If you are a developer and want to use obexftp library or even
cobex/bfb library do so. But please keep me informed - I'll send
you pre-releases. That way your application is able to exploit the
newest library features.


Debugging
---------

remove all ObexFTP installations from your system. Build using
	CFLAGS="-DOBEXFTP_DEBUG=5" ./configure
	make clean ; make
Start debugging using
	./apps/obexftp [...]

You might want to try picking up compiler warnings too (and mail them to me)
	CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g -Wall -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes \
		-Werror" ./configure
	make clean ; make
Please mail me all warnings and error, if any.
