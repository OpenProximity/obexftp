ObexFTP to do list
==================

* obexftpd server with simple inbox (like IrCP)

* "Something went wrong" -- help texts

* Verify unified cable support.

* Discover port and protocol to use (i.e. Bt, IrDA, TTY)

* Tear down BFB connection cleanly - no more cable cycling.

* Document the general vs Siemens specific features

* Path parsing issues (some phones dont know about paths others insist on them)

* Error hanling on missing files (either TA or M)

* Use the TAC (Type Approval Code) perhaps. (http://www.nobbi.com/glossar.htm#imei)
