==================

* "Something went wrong" -- help texts

* Debbug unified cable support problems with Ericsson phones.

* Discover port and protocol to use (i.e. IrDA, Ericsson or Siemens)

* Tear down BFB connection cleanly - no more cable cycling.

* Document the general vs Siemens specific features

* Path parsing

* Error hanling on missing files (either TA or M)

* Use the TAC (Type Approval Code) perhaps. (http://www.nobbi.com/glossar.htm#imei)
