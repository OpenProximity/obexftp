NAME
    obexftp - Mobile Equipment file transfer tool

SYNOPSIS
    obexftp [*OPTION*] [*COMMANDS*]

DESCRIPTION
    obexftp is used to access files on mobile equipment, i.e. cell phones.

    This tool lets you access the ObexFTP library by the means of a command
    line interface. You might consider using the other means available. E.g.
    GTK Client gObexFtp, Gnome-VFS-Module vfs-obexftp and some others.

OPTIONS
    The ordering of options is important. Every command will use the most
    recent device set. Every file without command switch will apply to the
    command given most recent. See EXAMPLES

    -b *device*, --bluetooth *device*

            first device found will be used.

    -B *number*, --channel *number*
            Use this bluetooth channel when connecting. The channel will be
            discoverd automatically if this option is not used.
