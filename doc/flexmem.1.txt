NAME
    flexmem - Siemens Mobile Equipment Flex.Mem tool

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    flexmem is used to access Flex. Memory on Siemens mobile equipment, i.e.
    S45 and ME45.

    This tool lets you access the ObexFTP library by the means of a command
    line interface. You might consider using the other means available. E.g.
    GTK Client gObexFtp, Gnome-VFS-Module vfs-obexftp and soon KDE VFS.

    recent device set. Every file without command switch will apply to the
    command given most recent. See EXAMPLES
